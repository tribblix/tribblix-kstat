Add example/pkstatserver.pl, a Mojolicious-powered REST service that
can be used by a JKstat client, which depends on most of the other
changes made here.

Expose ks_type so consumers know what type of kstat they're dealing with.

All times (snaptime, crtime, the times in IO kstats) are reported in
the underlying raw nanoseconds, rather than being converted into
seconds.

Added getKCID for JKstat compatibility.

Fix typo retured.

Rename Sun::Solaris::Kstat to Tribblix::Kstat so as to avoid naming
collisions.

Restore a copy of the old perl kstat utility and man page, as
perlkstat. This is to provide an easy way to check the module itself
is functional.
